# Tester69 rewrite

[![](https://discord.com/api/guilds/733219077744754750/embed.png)](https://discord.gg/Xjn4uvk6KS)

A general-use discord bot coded in python using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## This is a rewrite of the original Tester69 bot, main change is the cog system, which is inspired by [DuckBot's](https://github.com/DuckBot-Discord/DuckBot) cog system. I will also be working on rewriting some systems, but the initial plan is to get all the cogs to work like normal
